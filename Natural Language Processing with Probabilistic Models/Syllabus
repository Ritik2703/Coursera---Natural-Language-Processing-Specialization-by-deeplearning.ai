In Course 2 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:

a) Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming, 
b) Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is important for computational linguistics, 
c) Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and 
d) Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model. 
   Please make sure that you’re comfortable programming in Python and have a basic knowledge of machine learning, matrix multiplications, and conditional probability.
   By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, 
   created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot! This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in 
   NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. 
   Łukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
